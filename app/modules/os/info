This directory is for storing modules that are specific for a given operating
system, for example the isolation implementations are orthogonal between the 
operating system families, the PRNG implementations are orthogonal between 
Windows and the standardized /dev/urandom systems, and so those modules are 
also here. 

unixLike includes modules that work inclusively on linux, osx, freebsd, openbsd,
and possibly other systems in the standard fashion. This includes for example 
the unixLike PRNG implementation, which is a /dev/urandom wrapper that should
work on any of these systems.

In some cases an implementation is to a more specific OS, such as the isolation
frameworks, for example the Linux isolation framework is built with SECCOMP and
namespaces, two features that are specific to the Linux kernel, and so this 
implementation is not stored in the unixLike directory but rather in the Linux
directory. 

Every unixLike operating system will need all of the modules in the unixLike 
directory, in addition to any specific modules in its own directory.
